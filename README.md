Discord bot  
This is a simple implementation of a discord bot using the discord.py rewrite library.
In order to run the bot you will need to generate a discord bot token as well as a reddit API app. They're free and easy to generate.

# Known bugs:
-Encoding problems in logging the messages.    
-Certain subreddits cause unexpected behaviour in the random function.    

# TODO:
- TODO make bot save images
