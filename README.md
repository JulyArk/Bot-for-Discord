Discord bot  
This is a simple implementation of a discord bot using the discord.py rewrite library.
The bot is intended for use in a single channel due to command repositiories being shared, but 
can and most likely will be adapted to multiple channels in the future.
In order to run the bot you will need to generate a discord bot token as well as a reddit API app. They're free and easy to generate.

# Known bugs:
-Encoding problems in logging the messages.    
-Certain subreddits cause unexpected behaviour in the random function.    

# TODO:
