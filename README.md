# Discord
Discord bot  
This is a simple implementation of a discord bot using the discord.py rewrite library.
The bot is intended for use in a single channel due to command repositiories being shared, but 
can and most likely will be adapted to multiple channels in the future.

# Known bugs:
-Encoding problems in logging the messages.    
-Certain subreddits cause unexpected behaviour in the random function.    

# TODO:
- TODO make bot save images
- TODO MAKE bot play music - bot can currently join/leave channels - postponed until bot is hosted
- TODO HOST BOT on a server
